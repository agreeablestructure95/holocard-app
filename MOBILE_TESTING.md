- [ ] Test network disconnection during auth
- [ ] Test invalid Google account scenarios
- [ ] Verify proper error messages
- [ ] Test logout functionality

### 14. Upload & Data Limits
- [ ] Test image upload size limits (>10MB)
- [ ] Test unsupported file formats
- [ ] Test network timeout during upload
- [ ] Verify error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Test data validation (long names, special characters)

### 15. AR Edge Cases
- [ ] Test in low light conditions
- [ ] Test with no detected surfaces
- [ ] Test camera permission denied
- [ ] Test unsupported device scenarios
- [ ] Verify graceful fallbacks

## Final Verification

### 16. Complete User Journey
**End-to-End Test:**
1. [ ] Device 1: Sign in, create profile, generate card
2. [ ] Device 1: Share QR code/URL
3. [ ] Device 2: Access shared card via QR/URL
